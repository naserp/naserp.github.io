## Abstract
Openflow provides a standard interface for separating a network into a data plane and a programmatic control
plane. This enables easy network reconfiguration, but introduces
the potential for programming bugs to cause network effects.
To study OpenFlow switch behavior, we used Alloy to create a
software abstraction describing the internal state of a network
and its OpenFlow switches. This work is an attempt to model the
static and dynamic behaviour a network built using OpenFlow
switches.
