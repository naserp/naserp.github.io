Hey there! I'm Naser, an ML engineer who's mastered the art of making algorithms dance and pedals spin. With years of experience at Twitter, I've tackled the toughest challenges in account and content integrity, all while sprinkling a bit of ML magic.

Outside of work, I love biking around the stunning landscapes of San Francisco. It's my way of enjoying nature and keeping in shape, especially along the scenic routes north of San Francisco.
