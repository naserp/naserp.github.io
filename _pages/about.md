Hey There! I'm Naser, an engineer with a knack for bringing models to life and handling complexities. Over several years at Twitter, I've addressed some of the challenges in account and content integrity, with a bit of ML magic.

In my spare time, I love [biking](https://photos.app.goo.gl/MSTYujUdByHQkApJ7) around the stunning landscapes of San Francisco. Itâ€™s my way of enjoying nature and keeping in shape, especially along the scenic routes north of San Francisco. 
On non-ride days I indulge in the simple pleasure of baking fresh sourdough [bread](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hTqXthm3g6AX7u7x9).
