Understanding User Embeddings on Social Media

User Embeddings in social media are a powerful technique to convert high-dimensional or non-tabular user features into a manageable low-dimensional space, facilitating a comprehensive user representation.

The following is a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g7o8lQBKkbj-hpfLZDDGBkcnEcXXpPvoWW5N96dOVAM/edit?usp=sharing) I gave at a meet up.

In summary, user embeddings offer a valuable tool to capture and interpret user behavior on social media, enabling the delivery of more personalized and effective experiences. Whether based on text, network data, or multiple views, these techniques offer rich and insightful user representations, enhancing our understanding and ability to engage with users on social media platforms.
