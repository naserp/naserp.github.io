As machine learning models grow larger and their training datasets become increasingly complex, the concept of machine unlearning has gained attention as a method to remove unwanted data influences from models without retraining them from scratch. Machine unlearning aims to edit away private data, outdated knowledge, copyrighted materials, toxic content, dangerous capabilities, and misinformation to improve AI safety.

What is Machine Unlearning?
Machine unlearning involves removing the influence of specific training data from a model. The goal is to produce an unlearned model that behaves as if it was trained without the unwanted data. 

Key Motivations for Unlearning:

Access Revocation: Removing private or copyrighted data from models, ideally treating data as "borrowed" and allowing it to be "returned."
Model Correction and Editing: Correcting models that were trained on undesirable data, such as toxic or biased content, to mitigate post-training risks.

Here is a Colab for a Unlearning project.
