In today's data-driven landscape, Apache Spark stands as a cornerstone for tackling complex data challenges. However, there are situations where Spark's native features may not meet all your requirements. This is where User-Defined Functions (UDFs) come to the rescue, allowing for customization that tailors Spark to your specific needs. You can delve into various UDF implementations with this [Sample Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11pq1m0oxQZJh2EPhYwax4bLKbriK05Uv?usp=sharing).

Spark SQL offers a built-in method to easily register UDFs by passing in a function in your programming language. Scala and Python can use native function and lambda syntax, but in Java we need to extend the UDF class.
UDFs can work on a variety of types and can return a different type than the one they are initially called with. In Python and Java, we need to specify the return type.

Spark's distributed architecture allows for scalable data processing, and when paired with User-Defined Functions (UDFs), the possibilities are truly endless. For instance, let's consider the need to apply Bert encoder logic to your data. With Spark, each partition can independently process its subset of the data through the UDF. This means that you can effectively distribute the task of Bert encoding across the entire cluster, achieving high throughput and speed. So, if you're looking to scale your data processing tasks, Spark DataFrames and UDFs offer a seamless and efficient way to do so.
